Integrity Basecamp Notifier
===========================

This lets Integrity alert Basecamp after each build is made.

Setup Instructions
==================

Just install this gem via `sudo gem install -s http://gems.github.com 
pyrat-integrity-basecamp` and then in your Rackup (ie, `config.ru`) file:

    require "rubygems"
    require "notifier/basecamp"
	Integrity::Notifier.register(Integrity::Notifier::Basecamp)

Now you can set up your projects to alert Basecamp after
each build (just edit the project and the config options should be 
there)


Example entries in the configuration are shown below:

The idea is that you setup a robot user on basecamp to post the build results, and decide on an existing project and category where you would like these messages to be posted.

Please submit any patches if you want to improve anything.
